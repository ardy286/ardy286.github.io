      'Chiffre exact' is a fun and strategic challenge where you must guess a mystery number chosen randomly. You start the game with an initial score of 50 points, which represents your attempt capital. The concept is simple: each round, you propose a number. If your guess is incorrect, not only do you lose 5 points, but the program helps by telling you if your guess is higher or lower than the target number. This allows you to gradually refine your guesses and get closer to the correct answer.

However, the pressure increases as your score decreases because if you reach zero before guessing the correct number, the game is lost. The challenge lies in your ability to make wise choices while considering the clues given by the program. On the other hand, if you manage to guess the exact number before your score drops to zero, victory is yours, proving your insight and logic. This game, both simple and captivating, will test your thinking and your ability to manage limited resources.

      The IT portal is an application designed to facilitate the management and sharing of educational resources within computer science departments. This platform allows professors to upload their materials, lecture notes, as well as various types of assessments such as exams, practical work (TP), projects, and share these resources with all the department's teachers.

For students, the application offers the possibility to submit their final session projects online via a submission platform like Git or GitLab, ensuring a structured and professional tracking of academic work. Additionally, the application includes a matchmaking system that allows students in need to find tutors among their peers. These peer tutors can provide valuable assistance to help students succeed in their computer science programs.

Another important feature of the application is its integration with the professional world. Companies can directly submit projects to the platform, thus providing students with practical opportunities to work on real-world cases while collaborating with their instructors. This professional aspect enriches students' training, enabling them to develop concrete skills and build experiences directly related to the job market.

By combining centralized content storage, an internal collaboration space, and connections to the professional world, the IT portal becomes an essential tool to strengthen the synergy between teachers, students, and companies.
